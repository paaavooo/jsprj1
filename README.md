## About The App
TODO-lista is an app that let's you set tasks for yourself and save them for later reminders. You can add tasks to it and when you have completed them you can simply just click "merkitse tehdyksi" to cross it over to signify that its completed. Also you can just remove already completed tasks or tasks that are no longer relevants by clicking "poista".

## Technologies
In this project HTML, CSS and JavaScript was used.

## Setup
You can download all the files to your computer and open them in any code editing software you prefer, for example Visual Studio code. You can now open the index.html file by using something like liveserver that the code editor provides, or you can open the file from your folder using browser.
If you just want to use the application there is a demo link for it above.

## Status
TODO-lista is ready and deployed
